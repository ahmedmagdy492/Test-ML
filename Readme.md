<h2>Linear Regression - Continous Problems:</h2>

<ul>
<li>you have a tranining set</li>
<li>first time generate 2 random numbers ceta0, ceta1</li>
<li>subistitute ceta0 as the slope and ceta1 as the y-intercept</li>
<li>calculate the loss of this prediction (the accuracy) using the error mean square algorithm</li>
<li>calculate a new ceta0 and a new ceta1 using the Gradient Descent algorithm</li>
<li>keep doing this for a specific number of times until you the loss comes closer to 0%</li>
</ul>

<mark>NOTE: here we are using the slope intercept form for a relation that has only one variable</mark>
